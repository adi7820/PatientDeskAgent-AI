# PatientDeskAgent-AI
**Automated front-desk assistant for healthcare — scheduling appointments, patient registration, and fetching medication data via agents.**

## 🎯 Problem & Motivation

Patient front-desks in clinics/hospitals handle a lot of routine but critical tasks:  
- scheduling appointments,  
- registering new patients,  
- fetching patient medication details,  
- answering common queries about medicines.

These tasks are repetitive, time-consuming, and often involve switching between multiple systems (hospital database, FHIR servers, medication info services).  

**PatientDeskAgent-AI** aims to automate and streamline these front-desk operations — reducing manual overhead, minimizing errors, and enabling healthcare staff to focus on patient care rather than administrative overhead.

## 💡 Solution Overview

PatientDeskAgent-AI uses a multi-agent architecture to automate common front-desk tasks:

- **Appointment Agent**: schedules new appointments and checks existing ones.  
- **Medication Agent**: fetches a patient’s medication history using FHIR (based on patient ID), and — via a Tavily MCP server — obtains detailed information about medicines on demand.  
- **Patient Intake Agent**: registers new patients; stores the registration details (e.g. demographics, contact info) in an `output/` folder.  
- **Primary Agent**: acts as an orchestrator. It receives user queries and delegates tasks to the appropriate agent (Appointment, Medication, or Patient Intake) using an agent-to-agent (A2A) communication protocol.  

All subordinate agents (Appointment, Medication, Patient Intake) run remotely; they communicate with the Primary Agent over the A2A protocol. This decoupled, agent-based design makes the system modular, extensible, and easier to maintain or scale (e.g. adding more agents in future).

## 🏗 Architecture / Design

![PatientDeskAgent-AI Architecture Diagram](adk_arch_diagram.png)

- Primary Agent routes user requests/queries.  
- Sub-agents handle domain-specific tasks.  
- Remote communication — enables each sub-agent to operate independently.  
- Data (like patient info or appointment logs) output to local `output/` folder or returned to user as responses.

## ✅ Features / Capabilities

- Schedule new appointments or look up existing appointments.  
- Register new patients — storing their info for later reference.  
- Fetch patient’s medication history (via FHIR) given their ID.  
- On-demand retrieval of medicine information from an external medicine-info server (Tavily MCP).  
- Modular architecture: new agents (e.g. billing, lab-results, reminders) can be added easily.

## ✅ Feature Inculded in Agent

- Multi-Agent system: Agent powered by an LLM
- Tools: MCP, custom tools
- Session & Memory: Sessions & state management (e.g. InMemorySessionService)
- Context engineering
- Observability: Logging, Tracing
- Agent evaluation
- A2A Protocol

## 🔄 Multi-Agent Communication via A2A + Docker-Compose

I adopt the A2A Protocol for inter-agent communication meaning that each sub-agent (appointment, medication/medical lookup, patient-intake) runs remotely (in its own container), and the main agent (the user-facing “primary agent”) interacts with them as remote services. This design shows each agent to a standalone service and enabling modularity even if agents are implemented in different languages/frameworks. 

To realize this, I use Docker Compose to spin up three remote-agent containers (e.g. app1, app2, app3) — each hosting one of the sub-agents.

These containers are exposed at different ports (e.g. 8001, 8002, 8003), so that the primary agent can discover and call them over A2A protocol when delegating tasks.

The mainapp application when started via **docker compose up --build** brings up all agents (primary + remote), ensuring the multi-agent system is ready out-of-the-box.

This architecture mirrors a microservices style setup for AI agents, each agent is independently deployable, runs in isolation in its own container, communicates over a Agen2Agent protocol, and collaborates to fulfill complex user queries.

## 🚀 Quick Start — Setup & Run

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed  
- Access to required remote services (FHIR server, Tavily MCP server)  
- Appropriate credentials / configuration: Google_API_KEY and Tavily_API_KEY. Example .env file is present in repo with name example.env.txt

### 🔧 Database Initialization — Before Starting the Server

Before launching the full stack, you also have to initialize the database used by the appointment agent. Although, it is already present in the repo:

```bash
# Move into the `appointment_agent` folder
cd PatientDeskAgent/appointment_agent

# Run the database initialization script
python db_init.py
```

This script sets up the necessary database schema (tables, initial state, etc.) required by the appointment-agent — ensuring that appointment booking and lookup works correctly once you bring up the containers.

### Build & Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adi7820/PatientDeskAgent-AI.git
cd PatientDeskAgent-AI

# Build and run all agents & services
docker compose up --build
```

This will build the Docker images and start all agents (Primary + sub-agents).

### Usage

Once containers are up, you can interact with the Primary Agent using ADK Web UI at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000). Based on your query (appointment scheduling, patient registration, med-info request), the Primary Agent will delegate to the proper sub-agent and return a response.

Example flows:

Schedule appointment → Primary Agent → Appointment Agent → returns confirmation / slot.

Register new patient → Primary Agent → Patient Intake Agent → patient data stored in output/.

Get medication history → Primary Agent → Medication Agent (interacts with FHIR) → returns meds list.

Ask about a medicine → Primary Agent → Medication Agent → queries Tavily MCP server → returns medicine details.
